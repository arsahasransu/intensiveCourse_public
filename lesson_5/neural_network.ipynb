    "## Code a neural network from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Details on neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Biology teaches us that the brain is constituted of neurons and connections between them: the synapses.\n",
    "By comparing the brain of various animals, we now think that the more the number of neurons and most importantly of synapses is large, the more complex are the functions that the brain can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn the inner workings of a very simplified mathematical model of brain: an artificual neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element is the neuron. The simplest model (and one of the first) we have is the [*perceptron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron). The neuron is modelled by a mathematical function that takes some arguments as inputs, combines them linearly, and returns an output value.\n",
    "We denote as *weights* the coefficients of the linear combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we want to be able to approximate nonlinear functions, so we need to plug in a degree of nonlinearity inside the neuron, and we want the neuron to fire only when a certain threshold in the output is reached (a certain amount of stimulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We modify the output of the neuron by an activation function $f_{act}$: the neuron is activated if the activation function returns a non-zero value. The output of the neuron is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_n = f_{act}(\\sum_i w_{i,n} x_{i,n})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the activation function is not linear, we are happy because we have obtained a neuron that gives a nonlinear output and gets activated only if the stimuli it receives are large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use in this exercise two activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)), a function $f(x)$ that returns 0 if $x<0$, and $x$ otherwise;\n",
    "- [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), a function that rescales any number into a number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you have a graphical representation of the perceptron, by [https://towardsdatascience.com](https://towardsdatascience.com):\n",
    "\n",
    "![neuron](https://miro.medium.com/max/1435/1*n6sJ4yZQzwKL9wnF5wnVNg.png \"Figure from https://towardsdatascience.com\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to connectthe neurons. The simplest way is to build layers of neurons, and to connect all neurons of consecutive layers. Starting with the inputs, there is a first layer of neurons. Each neuron combines linearly the inputs and passes the result through activation function to give an output value. The set of outputs of a layer will be the input of the following layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "![neuralnet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Colored_neural_network.svg/800px-Colored_neural_network.svg.png \"Figure from wikipedia\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is characterized by a set of weights assigned to the connections that define the structure of the network. You can see this as a mathematical function with many free parameters (the weights) that takes the inputs and gives an output. The problem of learning is then the problem of finding the values of the free parameters that minimize the difference between the output and the target distribution that we want to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The training process\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, the training process consists in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- for each epoch\n",
    "   * for each training set data point:\n",
    "      1. calculate the output of each neuron, starting from the inputs to the output\n",
    "      2. compare the output of the last neuron with the reference wine quality\n",
    "      3. propagate the error back towards the inputs, without updating the weights (the error needs to be propagated with respect to the current values of the weights)\n",
    "      4. update all the weights\n",
    "      5. save the value of the loss function for each event\n",
    "   * for each test set data point:\n",
    "      1. save the value of the loss function for each event\n",
    "   * aggregate the errors by computing a Mean Squared Average (MSE)\n",
    "      1. the MSE of the errors in the training dataset events is the average training loss\n",
    "      2. the MSE of the errors in the test dataset is the averate validation loss (you see here I am using validation and test indifferently)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is the training will stop when the loss function doesn't improve anymore (it remains stationary at its minimum. If the training loss keeps diminishing and the test loss begins increasing, then we might be starting to learn statistical fluctuations of the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clarification on the connections between networks (to fix ideas)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the network has the following structure: (input layer: two inputs `A` et `B`;  first internal (_hidden_) layer: two neurons `1a` et `1b`; second hidden layer: two neurons `2a` et `2b`; output `y`), the list of connections (the weights) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Four weights connecting the inputs to the layer 1:\n",
    "    - `wA1a` (connects input `A` to neuron `1a`)\n",
    "    - `wA1b` (connects input `A` to neuron `1b`)\n",
    "    - `wB1a` (connects input `B` to neuron `1a`)\n",
    "    - `wB1b` (connects input `B` to neuron `1b`)\n",
    "- Four weights connecting the neurons of layer 1 to those of layer 2:_\n",
    "    - `W1a2a` (connects neuron `1a` to neuron `2a`)\n",
    "    - `W1a2b` (connects neuron `1a` to neuron `2b`)\n",
    "    - `W1b2a` (connects neuron `1b` to neuron `2a`)\n",
    "    - `W1b2b` (connects neuron `1b` to neuron `2b`)\n",

    "    - `W2ay` (connects neuron `2a` to output `y`)\n",
    "    - `W2by` (connects neuron `2b` to output `y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform backpropagation we need, for each neuron, to propagate back the error of the neurons of the following layer (so you need to go backwards). We use the chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error for a neuron of the output layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon = (y_{true} - \\hat{y}) * activation\\_derivative(\\hat{y})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\hat{y}$ is the output of this output neuron, and $y_{true}$ is the target quality of the wine\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error for a neuron $m$ of an internal layer $N$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{m, N} = \\sum_{k} (w_{k, N+1} * \\epsilon_{k, N+1}) * activation\\_derivative(\\hat{m})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\epsilon_{k,N+1}$ is the error of the neuron $k$ of the following layer (layer $N+1$), $w_{k, N+1}$ is the weight of the connection between the neuron $m$ and the neuron $k$ of the next layer, and $\\hat{m}$ is the output of neuron $m$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating the weights\n",
    "\n",
    "After having backpropagated all the gradient, you have to update all the weights using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w = w + learning\\_rate * erreur * input\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ici $erreur$ is the error calculated via backpropagation, $input$ is the input value of the neuron that had been originally passed to the neuron, and $learning rate$ is a parameter governing how fast we climb down the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### At the end of each epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for convergence of the network, a standard practice is to aggregeate the errors $\\hat{y} - y_{true}$  of all the events at the end of each epoch, in order to reduce the sensitivity to statistical fluctuations in the training sample. The first pillar of statistical wisdom according to Stigler is precisely aggregation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In analogy with $\\chi^2$ fit, we can for example calculate the $MSE = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{events} (\\hat{y}-y_{true})^2$ and plot the MSE as a function of the number of epochs. If the network is improving its predictions, we should see something like this:\n",
